# Example

This presents an example on how MethodScope can be used to extract information from encrypted arithmetic functions.

The function utilized is the derivative update for a Peltier cell space-state model, originally proposed in the work: [Non-linear identification of a Peltier cell model using evolutionary multi-objective optimization](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2405896317307152)

## How to run

1. Clone this repository with `git clone https://github.com/WinX64/method-scope.git`

2. Add the `scope` folder and its subfolders to MATLAB's path

3. Run the file `example/Example.m`
